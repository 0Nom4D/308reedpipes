DESCRIPTION
        r0      radius (in cm) of pipe at the 0cm abscissa
        r5      radius (in cm) of pipe at the 5cm abscissa
        r10     radius (in cm) of pipe at the 10cm abscissa
        r15     radius (in cm) of pipe at the 15cm abscissa
        r20     radius (in cm) of pipe at the 20cm abscissa
        n       number of points needed to display the radius
